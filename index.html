  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is the practice of priortizing content instead of technology. Instead of focusing on more 
    advanced browsers like with Graceful degradation. With Graceful degradation, the best  browsers get the newest and best versions while others get the passable but not so great versions of the content 
    Progressive enhancement focuses on content by splitting up the three aspects of a web page and if a device so 
    chooses to accsess one or more of those aspects it can do so. Sometimes a device wants to only look at the HTML like 
    search engines or screen readers. a lot of times a device may want to see the CSS so the user can see the designs. other times
    a user may want to have some functionality, which can be done with Java script. the point is instead of versions for the best 
    browsers, we should allow each browser to accsess what they want or need equally. if a device can use javascript then it can use 
    it, otherwise HTML and CSS should work just fine for that device. likewise when a user depends on the developers
    HTML skills, they deserve to be prioritized too. <br>

<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>
 When it comes to the experience I had when creating the dragon project, I think my stongest skill was creating the CSS. // 
 My greatest weakness was formatting the HTML to be clean and consistent. I think this project has allowed me to see what does and 
 does not work for me when it comes to having a work flow. I found myself have trouble with CSS only because the HTML was 
 not formatted the best it could be. 
</p>
<p>
  when I asked for feed back from my peers they pointed out that the visual effects across the page were not 
  always consistent. In order to not confuse the viewer, I changed that to make the links visual effects all the same instead of 
  just on the home page. Anogther thing I had to add was alt text to the images

</p>
<p>
  I think if I had to restart this project, I would focus a lot more on writing the HTML. utilizing 
 section tags the most. This would prevent me from running into some of the problems I did the with CSS
